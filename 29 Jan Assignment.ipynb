    "\n",
    "which type of programming does python support?\n",
    "1. Procedural Programming: Python supports procedural programming, which involves organizing code into reusable procedures or functions that can be called when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Python supports OOP, which allows users to define classes and objects that encapsulate data and behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Functional Programming: Python supports functional programming, which involves using \n",
    "pure functions that don't have side effects and avoid changing state.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Aspect-oriented Programming: Python also supports aspect-oriented programming, \n",
    "which allows users to separate cross-cutting concerns such as logging and error handling from the main logic of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Scripting: Python is often used as a scripting language, \n",
